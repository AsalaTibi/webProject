    <h1>The Top 20 Biggest Nutrition Myths</h1>
    <p>
        Scrolling through social media, reading your favorite magazine, or visiting popular websites<br>
        exposes you to endless information about nutrition and health — most of which is incorrect.<br><br>

        Even qualified health professionals, including doctors and dietitians, are to blame for spreading<br>
        misinformation about nutrition to the public, adding to the confusion.<br><br>

        Here are 20 of the biggest myths related to nutrition, and why these antiquated beliefs need to<br>
        be put to rest.

    <b><li>‘Calories in, calories out’ is all that matters when it comes to weight loss</li></b>
    Though creating a calorie deficit by burning more energy than you take in is the most important<br>
    factor when it comes to weight loss, it’s not the only thing that matters.<br><br>

    Relying solely on calorie intake doesn’t account for the large number of variables that may<br>
    prevent someone from losing weight, even when on a very low calorie diet.<br><br>

    For example, hormonal imbalances, health conditions like hypothyroidism, metabolic<br>
    adaptations, the use of certain medications, and genetics are just some of the factors that may<br>
    make weight loss harder for some people, even when they’re on a strict diet .<br><br>

    This concept also fails to emphasize the importance of sustainability and diet quality for weight<br>
    loss. Those following the “calories in, calories out” method typically concentrate solely on the<br>
    calorie value of foods, not their nutrient value .<br><br>

    This can lead to choosing low calorie, nutrient-poor foods like rice cakes and egg whites over<br>
    higher calorie, nutrient-dense foods like avocados and whole eggs, which isn’t the best for<br> overall health.

        <h3>Summery</h3>
        <p>The “calories in, calories out” theory doesn’t account for several variables that may<br>
            prevent someone from losing weight. Many factors, such as genetics, medical<br>
            conditions, and metabolic adaptations, make weight loss much harder for some.</p>
    </div>
    <b><li>High fat foods are unhealthy </li></b>
    <p>Though this antiquated and incorrect theory is slowly being put to rest, many people still fear<br>
        high fat foods and follow low fat diets in the hopes that cutting their <br>
        fat intake will benefit their overall health.<br><br>

        Dietary fat is essential for optimal health. Plus, low fat diets have been linked to a greater risk of<br>
        health issues, including metabolic syndrome, and may lead to an increase in insulin resistance<br>
        and triglyceride levels, which are known risk factors for heart disease .<br><br>

        What’s more, diets that are higher in fat have been proven just as effective — or even more so — <br>
        than low fat diets when it comes to encouraging weight loss (6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).<br><br>

        Of course, extremes in either direction, whether it be a very low fat or very high fat diet, may<br>
        harm your health, especially when diet quality is poor.</p>

    <div class="summery">
        <h3>Summery</h3>
        <p>Many high fat foods are extremely nutritious and can help you maintain a healthy<br>
            weight.</p>

    <b><li>Breakfast is the most important meal of the day </li></b>
    <p>While it was once thought that eating breakfast was one of the most important factors in setting<br>
        yourself up for a healthy day, research has shown that this might not be the case for most adults<br><br> .

        For instance, research indicates that forgoing breakfast may result in reduced calorie intake.<br><br>

        Moreover, partaking in intermittent fasting, during which breakfast is either skipped or<br>
        consumed later in the day, has been linked to a plethora of benefits, including improved blood<br>
        sugar control and reductions in inflammatory markers .<br><br>

        However, intermittent fasting can also be accomplished by consuming a regular breakfast then<br>
        having your last meal earlier in the evening to maintain a fasting window of 14–16 hours.<br><br>

        Keep in mind that this does not apply to growing children and teens or those with increased<br>
        nutrient needs, such as pregnant women and those with certain health conditions, as skipping<br>
        meals may lead to negative health effects in these populations .<br><br>

        On the other hand, some evidence shows that eating breakfast and consuming more calories<br>
        earlier in the day rather than at night, coupled with reduced meal frequency, may benefit health<br>
        by reducing inflammation and body weight.<br><br>

        Regardless, if you enjoy breakfast, eat it. If you’re not a breakfast person, don’t feel the need to<br>
        add it to your daily routine.</p>
